# Theseus

A library for differentiable nonlinear optimization built on PyTorch to support constructing various problems in robotics and vision as end-to-end differentiable architectures.

The current focus is on nonlinear least squares with support for sparsity, batching, GPU, and backward modes for unrolling, truncated and implicit, and sampling based differentiation. This library is in beta with expected full release in mid 2022.


## Getting Started
- Prerequisites
    - We *strongly* recommend you install `theseus` in a venv or conda environment.
    - Theseus requires `torch` installation. To install for your particular CPU/CUDA configuration, follow the instructions in the PyTorch [website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
    - Theseus also requires [`suitesparse`](https://people.engr.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html), which you can install via:
        - `sudo apt-get install libsuitesparse-dev` (Ubuntu).
        - `conda install -c conda-forge suitesparse` (Mac).
    
- Installing
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/theseus.git && cd theseus
    pip install -e .
    ```
- Running unit tests
    ```bash
    pytest theseus
    ```
  By default, unit tests include tests for our CUDA extensions. You can add the option `-m "not cudaext"` to 
  skip them when installing without CUDA support.
- See [tutorials](tutorials/) and [examples](examples/) to learn about the API and usage.
