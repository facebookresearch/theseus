This folder contains examples of how to use Theseus for several applications:

- state_estimation_2d.py: Is an example of how to do 2D pose estimation from simulated
noisy GPS and odometry sensors. In this example the noise is state dependent, and we
learn the cost weight as a function of pose. 
- motion_planning_2d.py: Is an example of how to set up a differentiable motion planning
problem, inspired by [Bhardwaj et al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.09591.pdf).
- tactile_pose_estimation.py: Is an example of how to set up learning models for
tactile pose estimation, as described in [Sodhi et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10664)
- backward_modes.py: Shows how to compute derivatives through Theseus solves and switch between backward modes.
- se2_inverse.py: Is an example of numerically computing the inverse of SE2. 
- homography_estimation.py: Is an example of learning features for dense feature-metric alignment of two images. Homography estimation happends in the inner loop with LM, and outer loop uses Adam with a four corner error to drive the feature optmization.

These can be run from your root `theseus` directory by doing

    python examples/state_estimation_2d.py
    python examples/motion_planning_2d.py
    python examples/tactile_pose_estimation.py
    python examples/backward_modes.py
    python examples/se2_inverse.py
    python examples/homography_estimation.py

The motion planning and tactile estimation examples require `hydra` installation which you can obtain
by running.

    pip install hydra-core

Any outputs generated by these scripts will be saved under `examples/outputs`. You can 
change this directory by passing the CLI option `hydra.run.dir=<your_directory>`
