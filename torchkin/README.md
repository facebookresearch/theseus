    <i>A library for differentiable kinematics</i>
</p>

-----

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- We *strongly* recommend you install torchkin in a venv or conda environment with Python 3.8-3.10.
- torchkin requires `torch` installation. To install for your particular CPU/CUDA configuration, follow the instructions in the PyTorch [website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

### Installing

- **pypi**
    ```bash
    pip install torchkin
    ```

- #### **From source**
    The simplest way to install torchkin from source is by running the following
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/theseus.git && cd theseus/torchkin
    pip install -e .
    ```
    If you are interested in contributing to torchkin, also install
    ```bash
    pip install -r ../requirements/dev.txt
    pre-commit install
    ```
    and follow the more detailed instructions in [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/facebookresearch/theseus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Example

#### An inverse kinematics example is available in [script](https://github.com/facebookresearch/theseus/blob/main/examples/inverse_kinematics.py).

```python
import torch

import torchkin as kin

# We can load a robot model from a URDF file
dtype = torch.float64
device = "cuda"
robot = kin.Robot.from_urdf_file(YOUR_URDF_FILE, dtype=dtype, device=device)

# Print robot name, number of links and degrees of freedom
print(f"{robot.name} has {len(robot.get_links())} links and {robot.dof} degrees of freedom.\n")

# Print joint id and name
for id, name in enumerate(robot.joint_map):
    # A joint is not fixed if and only if id < robot.dof
    print(f"joint {id}: {name} is {'not fixed' if id < robot.dof else 'fixed'}")
print("\n")

# Print link id and name
for link in robot.get_links():
    print(f"link {link.id}: {link.name}")

# We can get differentiable forward kinematics functions for specific links
# by using `get_forward_kinematics_fns`. This function creates three differentiable
# functions for evaluating forward kinematics, body jacobian and spatial jacobian of
# the selected links, in that order. The return types of these functions are as
# follows:
#
# - fk: return a tuple of link poses in the order of link names
# - jfk_b: returns a tuple where the first is a list of link body jacobians, and the
#          second is a tuple of link poses---both are in the order of link names
# - jfk_s: same as jfk_b except returning the spatial jacobians
link_names = [LINK1, LINK2, LINK3]
fk, jfk_b, jfk_s = kin.get_forward_kinematics_fns(
    robot=robot, link_names=link_names)

batch_size = 10
# The joint states are in the order of the joint ids
joint_states = torch.rand(batch_size, robot.dof, dtype=dtype, device=device)

# Get link poses
link_poses = fk(joint_states)

# Get body jacobians and link poses
jacs_b, link_poses = jfk_b(joint_states) 

# Get spatial jacobians and link poses
jacs_s, link_poses = jfk_s(joint_states) 
```
