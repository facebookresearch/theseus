    "# Theseus\n",
    "\n",
    "Theseus is a library for differentiable nonlinear optimization built on PyTorch. \n",
    "\n",
    "Theseus is motivated by problems in robotics and computer vision that can be formulated as differentiable nonlinear least squares optimization problems, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), motion planning, and bundle adjustment. These problems can be broadly categorized as doing <i>structured learning</i>, where neural components can be modularly mixed with known priors to get the benefit of deep learning in a way that adds value over classical methods. While interest in this area is rapidly increasing, existing work is fragmented and built using application-specific codebases. Theseus fills this gap by providing a problem-agnostic platform for structured learning, letting the user easily combine neural networks with priors represented as differentiable blocks of nonlinear optimization problems, and do end-to-end training over these. \n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial introduces the basic building blocks for solving such optimization problems in Theseus; in the following tutorials, we will show how to put together these building blocks to solve optimization problems with various aspects and increasing complexity. We cover six conceptual building blocks in this tutorial: \n",
    "* **Variables:** named wrappers for torch tensors that form the fundamental data type for defining optimization problems in Theseus. (Section 1)\n",
    "* **Cost functions:** computes an error term as a function of one or more variables, and which are the functions to be minimized by Theseus optimizers. (Section 2)\n",
    "* **Cost weights:** computes a weight that modifies the contribution of one or more cost functions to the overall objective. (Section 3)\n",
    "* **Objective:** compiles multiple cost functions and weights to define the structure of an optimization problem. (Section 4)\n",
    "* **Optimizer:** implements an optimization algorithm (e.g., Gauss-Newton, LevenbergMarquardt) that can be used to minimize an Objective. (Section 5)\n",
    "* **TheseusLayer:** groups an objective and optimizer and serves as the interface between torch modules upstream/downstream and differentiable optimization problems. (Section 6)"

    "The `TheseusLayer` allows for backpropagation, and is semantically similar to a layer in a PyTorch neural network. Backpropagating through the `TheseusLayer` allows for learning of any necessary quantities of the problem, such as cost weights, initial values for the optimization variables, and other parameters for the optimization. The following tutorials will illustrate several applications for learning with a `TheseusLayer`.\n",

    "To distinguish between the optimization done by the Theseus optimizers, and those done outside the Theseus optimizers (e.g., by PyTorch's autograd during learning), we will refer to them as *inner loop optimization* and *outer loop optimization*, respectively. Note that the inner loop optimization optimizes only the optimization variables, and the outer loop optimization can optimize torch tensors associated with selected variables provided to the PyTorch autograd optimizers. A call to `TheseusLayer` `forward()` performs only inner loop optimization; typically the PyTorch autograd learning steps will perform the outer loop optimizations. We will see examples of this in the following tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the outer loop, we will commonly want to update Theseus variables before running inner loop optimization; for example, to set initial values for optimization variables, or to update auxiliary variables with tensors learned by the outer loop. We recommend that such updates to Theseus variables are done via `TheseusLayer.forward()`. While variables and objectives can be updated independently without going through `TheseusLayer.forward()`, following this convention makes it explicitly what the latest inputs to the `TheseusLayer` are, helping to avoid hidden errors and unwanted behavior. Therefore, we recommend that any updates during learning be performed only via the `TheseusLayer`."
